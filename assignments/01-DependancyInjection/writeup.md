# Dependancy Injection Bomb Puzzle

In this assignment you are to diffuse the bomb!

In [bomb.py](bomb.py), you will see an `explosives` superclass and a `bomb`
subclass. The `explosives` class handles the actual explosion, which you are
to prevent, and the `bomb` class handles outputting the *code* which provides
confirmation to the bomber that the bomb went off. Your goal is to print the
*code* without setting off the explosives.

You should write your code in a file called `"<computing_id>_diffuser.py"`. You
may import anything from [bomb.py](bomb.py), but note that I will test your
diffuser with a different *code*, so you can't just print out the code provided.

Good Luck, Have Fun!
