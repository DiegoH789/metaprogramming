# Limited Lines Puzzle

An `image` class is provided in [shrinkme.py](shrinkme.py). However, it is not
written very well. Although line-count is by no means a good indicator of code
quality, a better version of [shrinkme.py](shrinkme.py) has significantly fewer
lines, so your task is to write an alternate `image` class (called "image") in
a file called `<computing_id>_shrinked.py`. You can test your shorter
implementation with [tests.py](tests.py).
