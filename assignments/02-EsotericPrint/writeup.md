# Esoteric Print Exploration

Your task is to make a callable object called `print` which has some unusual
behavior. If you try to print the same thing three times in a row, the `print`
object should print the first two things like normal but instead of printing the
third thing, it should print a message to the programmer. Feel free to make this
message funny. You can also add other creative esoteric behavior, as long as it
doesn't *completely* trivialize the print functionality. The funniest `print`
implementations will get shoutouts in lecture!
