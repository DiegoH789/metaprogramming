# Restricted Function

For this assignment you are to write a function. You should name the function
your computing id. The function should take in no parameters.

If the function is called from its own file, it should return some secret
message. Otherwise, it should return "Access Denied".

For example if I were to write a seperate file, import your file, and call your
function, I should get "Access Denied". However, if you call the method in your
own file, it should return the secret.
